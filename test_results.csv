Same can be said for you class, as every few months blizzard will update the game and suddenly the class that was once considered bad is suddenly one of the best. If you don't have any intention of doing the absolute hardest content available, you can pick whatever race/class combo you want and you'll do just as well as everyone else doing the content you do. If you *do* intend on paying attention to what is technically, mathematically, the best choice, if not the most fun, and if only by a very small margin, then you need to do a *lot* more reading than you're probably going to be able to understand as a new WoW player. tl;dr: play whatever you want it doesn't matter that much :) &amp;#x200B; edit: For your very first character I would at least recommend playing a Damage spec instead of a Tank or healer, as the players you group with will have a lot of expectations about your knowledge of the game in those roles, especially Tanks.|||0.055|||0.055|||0.15|||0.9596

The community chooses to follow streamers or CE guilds and most of that is well established from years of previous faction imbalance which led to preference over time.  The best solution would be to quit your job and become a relevant streamer/ community figure that plays alliance so you can bring more (probably newer) players to the alliance. Jokes aside I wouldn’t mind maiming alliance or even switching one toon but then I’d feel compelled to switch my alts that do all the supplemental professions and even my crappy rogue that I just have to open lock boxes. I have an alt guild that I use to store/move things around. Players have a personal infrastructure that’s hard to give up. Most of those players established themselves on horde years ago.|||0.056|||0.056|||0.07|||-0.25

You are in way over your head. Normally I tell people Brazil can be safe enough if you are sensible, but you two are going to be immediately identified as overly confident and out of your depth.  If your brother is having a difficult time right now I would strongly consider the possible effect on him if the trip goes badly wrong. My advice would be aim a little smaller for the first trip and then plan a second one to look forward to at a later date.  If its of interest a lot of the Amazon is in Peru and not even that far from Machu Pichu.  There would be no need to cross the continent from Peru to Brazil to see the same forest.|||0.092|||0.092|||0.104|||-0.0644

Go to Peru.  Machu Picchu is one of those sites that does not disappoint. Doing the Inca Trail is something you will never forget.  The whole Sacred Valley area is packed with cool shit. Peru also has the Amazon (Iquitos or Puerto Maldonado) Among lots of other amazing things to see. Such as: * Rainbow Mountain * Colca Canyon/Arequipa * Nazca Lines * Lake Titicaca And SO much more. Peru also has reasonable tourist infrastructure so you can do a lot of booking from home. Domestic flights are reasonably cheap. If you've never booked a self guided international trip before it can be daunting, but Google is your friend. This forum and the forums on TripAdvisor (not the shitty listings for hotels, restaurants, and activities those are trash) are helpful for specific questions.  [WikiVoyage](https://www.wikivoyage.org/) is a decent place to start learning about areas.  But COVID has to be a consideration. I think the idea of you both being vaccinated and protected by April/May is very optimistic.|||0.04|||0.04|||0.13|||0.9246

Be in mind that Machu Picchu + the Brazilian amazon won't leave time to visit other places in Brazil. I don't think is a good combination if you intend to explore Brazil more deeply. 2) Covid is indeed a deal breaker right now. Even if you guys are vaccinated you never know what to expect. Cities and states can be put under lockdown or night-time curfew suddenly. Flights from Peru to Brazil could be suspended (as they are right now). In my opinion Brazil deserves an exclusive trip, but right now I believe you won't have a good experience. If you really wanna come to South America, you should maybe visit Peru only, or Peru + Bolivia (I have absolutely no idea about the Covid situation in those countries).|||0.076|||0.076|||0.04|||-0.7768

Putting all stars in every event takes away from that. I think the format you suggested would be really cool and maybe the players chosen to compete in the skills/dunk/3pt contest could still be drafted to each team to give them points instead of having the captains pick all stars to compete.|||0|||0|||0.085|||0.7778
